                    sculpture of Baby Groot, a testament to his artistic abilities during his high school days.
                    Motivated to expand his knowledge and skills, Logan's primary focus is to accumulate as much
                    learning as possible and build a comprehensive and practical portfolio. While pursuing his design
                    ambitions, Logan finds joy in both the exhilarating activity of rock climbing and immersing himself
                    in the world of gaming. The discovery of UX design has transformed Logan's perspective on products,

                <h2>Holly Chong </h2>
                <p>Holly Chong, a resident of Orange County, California, brings determination and a fresh perspective to
                    her program as she aims for a successful career transition. Revealing her immense love for
                    Disneyland as a fun fact, Holly admits her desire to have a pass if she had more time, adding a
                    touch of lightheartedness to her personality. In a photo where she is without her glasses, Holly
                    finds amusement in a significant gap in scores. Since starting the boot camp, Holly has developed a
                    critical eye for design, often thinking, "That's bad design... I could do better!" She has gained a
                    deeper understanding of empathy towards users, which translates into her ability to solve problems
                    effectively. Holly envisions herself designing solutions that are intuitive and don't require users
                    to think too much. The phrase "designed with people in mind" now holds greater significance for her,
                    and she recognizes the importance of designing for usability and inclusivity rather than solely
                    focusing on aesthetics or personal enjoyment. Previously, Holly associated design with something
                    visually pleasing or joyful, but her perspective has shifted. She now prioritizes empathy and
                    considers real people's needs in her design process. While Holly is unsure about her exact future
                    path, she is certain that wherever she ends up, she will approach design with empathy and a
                    user-centric mindset.</p>

                    profound impact on Sofia, rewiring her brain in unexpected ways. While she notices flaws in UI
                    design in various apps, she also contemplates how she wants to represent herself as a designer and
                    what unique contribution she can make. Initially, she felt intimidated by the competitiveness of the
                    industry, but Sofia rewired her thinking and silenced the self-doubt. She is determined to make room
                    for herself in the world of UX/UI and wants to be a voice for those who are unheard. Sofia aims to
                    bring people together through thoughtful and accessible design decisions. The boot camp has shown
                    her the wide range of roles in UX and reinforced that there is space for many individuals in the
                    field. Sofia's commitment to growth is evident as she seeks opportunities to transition to Apple
                    Corporate, utilizing her updated resume and showcasing her skills and perspective on UX in her cover
                    letter. With patience and optimism, Sofia awaits a response, hoping to soon join the team in
